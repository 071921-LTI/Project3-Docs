Team: 
  Indexing Crew
Members: 
  Micheal Wilder, Timothy St. Dennis
What we did yesterday: 
  We have implemented the map from CWT into Triplnr without much issue. Started working on research for indexing.
Plan for today: 
  Implement indexing on test db to demonstrate during P3 that we can index.
Blockers: 
  The amount of data required to make a noticeable impact on indexing results can eat up a lot of time.
Resolution: 
  We're not using real addresses for the index DB, in addition, we've figured out how to use mockaroo to achieve
  the data that we've required. (Being able to merge different columns, etc.)
